                <p>I worked for IBM as a programmer in the past and took a break to raise my family.  I have always enjoyed working on the computer.  Much of our household tasks are digitalized, from family finances to household chores.  I’m eagerly anticipating work that stimulates me intellectually.  
                  Since leaving IBM, I have done many diverse things.  Starting slow, with leading Girl Scout troops and teaching religious ed classes. Then stepping up to overseeing regional Girl Scout financial accounts and part time jobs.  Most recently, I’ve led the formation of a new 501c3 non-profit, Marina’s Miles (see MarinasMiles.org) which has awarded $12,000 in scholarships over the past three years, and has almost twice that invested for future scholarships.</p>
                <p>I enjoy spending time with my family, bicycling, reading, hiking and just being outside (in almost any kind of weather – as long as I’m dressed properly!).</p>
